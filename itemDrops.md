### The Item Drop Table

## My Plan

The main idea of this feature is to show the item drops of all mobs/entities in minecraft, starting of course with the 4 classic hostile entities. I also plan to possibly add links which connect the items listed to Aiden's crafting list to show which items are able to be used to craft other items.

| Entity  | Item(s) Dropped (Common Drops)  | Amount  | Picture  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creeper  | Gunpowder  | 0-2  | ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/minecraftCreeper.png) |
| Skeleton  | Arrow, Bone   | 0-2, 0-2  | ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/minecraftSkeleton.png) |
| Spider  | Spider Eye, String  | 0-1, 0-2  | ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/minecraftSpider.png) |
| Zombie  | Rotten Flesh  | 0-2  | ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/minecraftZombie.png) |
