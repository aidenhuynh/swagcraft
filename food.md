## Jeffrey Lee's Ideation for Create Performance Task
> My main idea was to create an updating database of Animes (types of mainstream Japanese animated shows) for users to visit, interact with and manipulate. If possible, I want there to be multiple lists utilizing tables and stylistic features through HTML, CSS, and SASS. The final product will have some form of user interaction, and some ideas that come to mind are upvoting and downvoting specific shows, adding/removing the user's own favorite shows to the list, and finally leaving reviews on shows currently in the database. 

### Visual Design
> There will definitely be tables involved with the frontend design, and I want to customize the page with images of the shows, alongside its own color scheme and font style.
